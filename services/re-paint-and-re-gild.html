        <h2 class="display-5">Headstone Letter Restoration</h2>
        <p>There can come a time when the lettering on a Headstone, Memorial or Gravestone becomes deteriorated. There are many factors that contribute to this and more effect Gold lettering in particular</p>
        <p>Watson Memorials can re-paint, re-gild or even change the colour of lettering. A very common situation is that the original stone was erected with Gold lettering, but due to the longer lasting nature of Silver, more and more customers choose to re-paint the lettering in Silver rather than the Gold.</p>
