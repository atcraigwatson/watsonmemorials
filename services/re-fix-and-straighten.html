        <h2 class="display-5">Re-fix or Straighten?</h2>
        <p>There is one significant difference between the need to straighten a Headstone, Memorial or Gravestone and the need to Re-fix one, <strong>stability</strong>. The stability of the Headstone, Memorial or Gravestone is down to its fixing methods and their current state.</p>
        <h3>Straightening a Headstone</h3>
        <p>This is required when the fixings are in their original state but the Headstone is leaning in a particular direction causing it to look un-level. This can happen to even the smallest memorial vase as most gravestones are fitted on soil that is likely to settle and move over time.</p>
        <h3>Re-fixing a Headstone</h3>
        <p>As an opposite to the above, re-fixing a headstone is required when its fixings are no longer in an adequate state. Watson Memorials is experienced is re-fixing all styles of Headstones, Memorials and Gravestones.</p>
        <p>If you feel the above do not match your requirements please call to discuss your specific memorial in more detail.</p>
