            <h2 class="mb-3">Designing Churchyard Memorials</h2>
            <p>When designing headstones for churchyards, the first step is always to find out what regulations the churchyard has in place for the erection of a memorial. Many Churchyards have rules specific to that Churchyard alone, the memorials found on this page cover the wider spectrum to give a good variety of design ideas and to help illustrate possibilities.</p>
            <p class="font-italics">All memorials can be crafted in any material, the decorative designs on the memorials are shown to illustrate possibilities and do not have to be on your chosen memorial.</p>
