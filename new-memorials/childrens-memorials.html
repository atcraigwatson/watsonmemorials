            <p>All children's memorial headstones can be crafted in any material, the decorative designs on the memorials are shown to illustrate possibilities and do not have to be on your chosen memorial. For example, the <em>Appleton</em> can be crafted in <em>Blue Pearl Granite</em> without the decorative carving.</p>
